    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The college owes its existence to the keen interest of Late Kandula Obul Reddy to develop technical education in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh. With a view to translating his noble ideal of imparting technical education into reality, a Technical Training Institute was started at Vempalli, Kadapa District in 1979 under the aegis of Sri Kandula Obul Reddy charities.</p>
    <p>K.S.R.M. College of Engineering was established in 1980 to perpetuate the memory of Late Sri. Kandula Srinivasa Reddy, youngest son of Late Sri Kandula Obul Reddy. Sri Kandula Srinivasa Reddy, a brilliant student of III year Mechanical Engineering at Delhi College of Engineering, New Delhi, met with his untimely death in a scooter accident on 18th October 1979.</p>
    <p>The college was formally inaugurated on 14th November 1980 by Sri T. Anjalah, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, and it started functioning from the academic year 1980-81.</p>
